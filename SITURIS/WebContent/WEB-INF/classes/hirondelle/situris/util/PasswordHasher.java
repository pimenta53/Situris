 Hash passwords.

 <P>A hash function is a one-way function that returns text that is difficult to reverse.
 A hash function is not an encryption, since the hashed value is never meant to be decrypted.
  
 <P>It is recommended that a random-but-fixed 'salt' value be added to a password before it 
 is hashed. That is not done here, but only because 
 Tomcat's implementation of form-based login allows for hashes, but not for salt values. 
 
 <P>Passwords should never be stored in cleartext. 
 All user passwords will pass through this class before they are stored in the database. 
 As well, when the user logs in, the submitted password is first hashed (again, using this class) 
 before the comparison with the stored value is made.
